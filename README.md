# aggregated_country_data_Shiny
R code for creating Shiny app with CNTI's aggregated country data. Allows users to interact with table and world map.

## Introduction to App
Welcome to our interactive R Shiny app! We created this app so users may update a world map with various information from our Datawrapper table. As of December 2023, users may view four different variables from our data table. 

Should any users wish to view the source code that created the application, there is a sidebar on the left-hand side of the side with a hyperlink to our GitHub repository. 

## Important Note

An earlier version of our application also included a reactive datatable (DT). Earlier commits to this repository include the full code to replicate that structure. In addition to the "Map" and "Code" sections, we also had "Data" and "About" items. 

Sincerely,
CNTI
